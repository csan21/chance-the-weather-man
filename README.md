# Chance the Weather Man

A very basic website that shows the current temperature in Chicago that has a drop down menu to select various moods & based on the mood selected, a Chance the Rapper song will play.

The purpose of this pair project was to learn about API's and them implement them. We used openweathermap for the temperature, and spotify/soundcloud for the songs.
